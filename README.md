# Google Books

Google Books is a sample iOS app written in Swift that uses book information from googleapis to display books about various topics from user searches. It uses a tableview with an async imageview for the cells. And a WKWebView to display the Google page about the book. The search page and cells are laid out using constraints programatically.
